Round 1: Online Assessment Round: This round was conducted on the CoCubes platform. There were three questions (med to hard level) to be completed in 70 minutes.

Suggestion: Practice DSA from GeeksforGeeks and Leetcode as it will give the confidence to solve problems.

Round 2: Technical Round (1.5 hrs): Those who could solve 2.5 to 3 questions were shortlisted for this round. The interview was on the Knox platform. The interview begins with a standard introduction.

Suggestion: Make sure the Knox platform works on your laptop and try to join 15 mins earlier to avoid last-time hassles.

Then he asked about my projects. I explained to him briefly about all projects I had. No cross-questions were asked at all. Although I got to know that people having machine learning projects were questioned a lot. ( I didn’t have any machine learning project).
Then he moved on to OS questions. Topics asked – Scheduling Algorithms, Priority Inversion, Paging, Virtual Memory, Page table, and Page replacement Technique. He covered almost all standard topics of OS.
Then he moved to DSA questions. I was asked three DSA questions and have to give the most optimal answers.
The questions were: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-product-array-puzzle/amp/, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-duplicates-in-on-time-and-constant-extra-space/amp/, and the last question was some priority queue question.
He also asked about the time complexity of the standard STL functions (like the time complexity of insert () in the set data structure )
Tips: Be very clear with CS concepts as any questions can come over during the interview. Also, try to start any DSA question from the brute force approach and explain it on the whiteboard with a full dry run.

Round 3: HR Round (15 mins): Got a call from HR after 3 days for the HR round. It was over the phone itself. Was asked standard HR questions.
