Installing repo :

$ mkdir -p ~/.bin
$ PATH="${HOME}/.bin:${PATH}"
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/.bin/repo
$ chmod a+rx ~/.bin/repo


Making custom project 

1)Initialise the repo:
	change the last name of the version of android u want to build 

	repo init -u git://gitrepo.sasken.com/mirror/aosp/kernel/manifest -b common-android12-5.10
2)Sync up the repo to download all the file 
	repo sync -c -j8
	
	-j8 - makes the process faster and uses 4 core of your cpu

Building up the aosp:
	
1)Choose the source to build 
	The default source for the build is envsetup.h and command is below
	source build/envsetup.h
2)Lunch option to choose the emulator you want to build 
	The command will show the list of devices and its architechure you want to build may be for phone or car accordingly whether to build it on x86_64 or arm-64 processer.
	$>lunch 
	
	The above command will show the list of devices u can build for 

	I have choose : sdk_car_x86_64-eng

	The command will be :
	
	$>lunch sdk_car_x86_64-eng

3) after choosing out path will be created within same folder and we need to build the system using make file:
	
	$>m -j16

	-j16 is used to speed up the process while it uses all 16 cores of the system.

That's it ,you will get a message saying build is successful after that you can run emulator

	$>emulator
